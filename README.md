# IMPORTANT REMINDER

For end projects you should contain the README.md file with the following:

 - link to live project
 - what the project does
 - what technology's have been used
 - what features you'd like to add
 - also if you swipe someone elses code give them some credit...

## It's compulsary for the project so don't forget it! 
## Keep a track of what you do otherwise you're gonna fail

## Also remember to do clear and accurate git updates as this is also compulsary to the project
